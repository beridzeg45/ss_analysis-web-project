intro_text="""ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my personal project : Tbilisi Apartment Prices Analysis - Dashboard which provides analtical insights on Tbilisi apartment prices by period, city part, apartment constraction status and renovation condition. 

*It visualizes apartment prices either by date, calendar week or month, hence provides meaningful insights how prices have been changing over time.
*Apart from this, it displays how prices vary by different geographical parts of the city, as well as availability of apartments for sale.
*Finally, frequency distribution of prices by construction status and condition.

The data is scraped from famous Georgian online real estate marketplace using python's BeautifulSoup and Selenium liabraries and updated on weekly basis.
The dashboard and graphs are powered by python's dash and plotly liabraries.
